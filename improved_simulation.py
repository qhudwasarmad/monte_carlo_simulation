"""
Improved simulation model for train delays and revenue loss.

This script calibrates delay distributions to match historical average
delays and cancellation rates for each station by constructing a mixed
model.  For each station we compute the mean delay of non-cancellation
events (mu) based on the historical average delay (hist_avg) and the
cancellation rate (hist_cxl):

    mu = (hist_avg - hist_cxl * 120.0) / (1.0 - hist_cxl)

We then simulate non-cancellation delays using a Beta(2,6) distribution
scaled to the interval [0, 4*mu].  The expected value of a Beta(2,6)
distribution is 2/(2+6) = 0.25, so the mean of the scaled distribution
is 0.25 * 4*mu = mu.  This ensures that the mean delay of all events
(cancellations and non-cancellations) matches the historical average
when the cancellation rate is applied.

Cancellation events are introduced with probability equal to the
historical cancellation rate.  When a cancellation occurs, the delay is
set to 120 minutes.  The revenue loss for cancellations is drawn from
a Gamma distribution with shape parameter equal to twice the sampled
gamma_alpha value; non-cancellations use a Gamma distribution with
shape equal to the sampled gamma_alpha.  In both cases the scale
parameter is set to 1.0, so the mean percentage loss is proportional
to the shape parameter.

The simulation also computes compensation claim counts for the standard
Delay Repay thresholds (15, 30, 60 minutes) and cancellations.
