# monte_carlo_simulation
A Monte Carlo simulation model for train delays, cancellations, and revenue loss. It calibrates delays with historical benchmarks, models disruption causes via Gamma distributions, and tracks Delay Repay compensation claims. Outputs include average delays, cancellation rates, and revenue loss, validated against real data.
